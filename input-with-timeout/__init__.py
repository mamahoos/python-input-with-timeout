# Input with Timeout

The 'input-with-timeout' module provides a cross-platform method to capture user input with a timeout feature.
This is particularly useful for creating command-line interfaces where the program needs to proceed if the user does not provide input within a certain time frame.

## Features

- Customizable `timeout` for user input.
- Cross-platform support (currently only Windows is supported).
- Easy integration with existing Python projects.

This module is part of the 'python-input-with-timeout' project by mamahoos, available at:
